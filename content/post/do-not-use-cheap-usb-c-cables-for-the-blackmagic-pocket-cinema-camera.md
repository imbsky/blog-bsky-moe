Well, I think you probably came to this blog post after experiencing the
following problems.

[Blackmagic Forum - BMPCC 6K keeps stopping](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=98589)

If you're using a terrible SSD, replace it. That is a necessary cost.

But, if you have a fast enough SSD and are experiencing this, I suspect that
there is a problem with the USB-C cable in many cases. (Even if your SSD isn’t
listed in the Blackmagic documentation.) Well, I suggested you shouldn’t use the
cheap USB-C cable in the title, but the problem is not the price but the cable
performance. You should buy a certified USB-C cable.

I hope this short blog post helps you.
